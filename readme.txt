Keyword research.

I recently read that keyword research was did. It was on a Facebook meme floating through some Amazon seller group I once followed. 
I doubt keywords are dead.  I do know that one of the greatest products for sale these days is the selling of expertise. Claim expertise and then sell it 
to others.
As others buy, you are verified the expert.

Is there a keyword standard. 
Meta data standards are pretty fascinating.
Ontologies.
RDF is kind of a ship in a bottle thing.

I flailed in the Tokyo interview. わたしは、日本語が少ないで間違いだらけですから。

The ontology piece would have been a piece of cake.
